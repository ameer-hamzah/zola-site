This is where I write all about my daily hobby projects that I do in my free time.

## ESP32

In this project, I have developed a webserver that I use to turn on and off built-in led of esp32.

### Future Work

1. Deploy a relay
2. Convert normal webserver to async
3. Use websocket instead of polling
4. Develop a mobile app
